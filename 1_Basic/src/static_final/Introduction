Static:
    1. When a class member is declared static, it becomes global for all other members of the class.
    2. A static variable and static method can be accessed with the class name in which it is defined
        followed by the dot(.) operator.
    3. Static block is executed only once when the class is loaded.

Final:
    Once a variable is declared as final; it can not be modified further in the program.
    A final variable must be initialized at the time declaration.
    The method declared as final can not be overridden by the subclass of that class in which final method is declared.
