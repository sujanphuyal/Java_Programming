An access modifier specifies which classes can access a given class and its fields, constructors and methods.

Different types of access modifiers:
	1. Public: class can be accessed from anywhere (within or outside the package and its class)
	2. Protected: class can be accessed only within the package and its class , if another package wants to access the class it needs to use "extends" keyword
	3. Default(lack of access modifier): can be accessed only within the package and its class
	4. Private: can be accessed only within the specific class
