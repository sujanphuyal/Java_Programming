Constructor is a block of code which is called whenever an instance of class is created.
It is a special type of method used to initialize the object.
Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.

There are two types of constructors:
    1. Default constructor (no-argument constructor)
    2. Parameterized constructor
