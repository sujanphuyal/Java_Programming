Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.

Advantages of Java Multithreading
    1) Threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.
    2) Performing many operations at once saves time.
    3) An exception in one thread does not affect other threads.

Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.
