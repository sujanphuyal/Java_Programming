An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program.
The Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle the runtime errors.

There are 5 keywords which are used in handling exceptions in Java.
    1. try: The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place exception code.
    2. catch: The "catch" block is used to handle the exception.
    3. finally: The "finally" block is used to execute the important code of the program.
    4. throw: The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception.
    5. throws: The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It doesn't throw an exception.
